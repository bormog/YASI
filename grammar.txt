TODO
 - semantic analysis ? (check order by col present in results)

- Expressions in insert: insert into foobar set foo = ( 1 + 1 ) * 2
- Multi expressions in select: select 1 + 1, 2 + 2
- Mix expressions and ids in select: select 1 + 1, foo from foobar

- Boolean logic in select: select foo from foobar where foo > 1
- Boolean expressions in select: select foo from foobar where foo > 1 or bar = 2
